    verify and quantify the value provided by the HR department to the organization
    enhance our ability to make our staff more efficient
    generate detailed, effective and up-to-date tracking of the career path of every employee in the company

    make the company more attractive for potential new hires

What are the numbers trying to tell us? Good data analysis will let us dive into the numbers to get important information on the past strategy of a company or team. Through these notebooks and exercises I will also point to potential areas of improvement and others that require further investigation, based on the numbers presented in each notebook. We shall proceed to clean the data first, and then to extract conclusions from it.
